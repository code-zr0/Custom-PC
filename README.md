## Upgrade Notes

- **GPU Upgrade (Nov 2025)**: Swapped the RTX 3080 for the newer RTX 5070 Ti to take advantage of DLSS 4.0 and improved ray tracing.
- **Power & Cooling**: The existing 850W PSU handled the upgrade without issue. Thermals remained extremely stable, even under intense performance.

## Build Goals

- **Performance**: Smooth 1440p/4K gaming and multitasking
- **Aesthetics**: Clean cable management, RGB accents, and a minimalist white/black theme
- **Thermals**: Efficient airflow and liquid cooling for sustained performance
- **Future-Proofing**: Modular components for easy upgrades

## Build Process

1. **Planning**: Researched parts compatibility, performance hinderances, power requirements, and airflow optimization.
2. **Assembly**: Installed CPU, RAM, and CPU waterblock on motherboard before mounting in case. Replaced GPU factory fans and heatsink with a custom waterblock and cover plate to watercool the GPU. 
3. **Cable Management**: Routed cables within the back panel of the case using Velcro ties and zip ties.
4. **BIOS & OS Setup**: Checked for part recognition within BIOS, optimized settings, made sure TPM was enabled. Installed Windows 11. Used flash drive to import WiFi drivers to connect to the internet (didn't have ethernet capability at the time).
5. **Stress Testing**: Ran benchmarks (Cinebench, 3DMark, FurMark) to validate stability.
